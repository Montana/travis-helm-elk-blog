When deploying an application, specifically on Kubernetes, it is required to define and manage several Kubernetes resources such as pods, services, deployments, and replicasets. These hooks all live in a YAML based file. Let's hop in.

## What is Helm? 

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It allows you to easily configure, add, remove things, and deploy applications and services on Kubernetes clusters.

## Usage

Let's grab Helm from Katakoda: 

```bash
curl -L https://git.io/get_helm.sh | bash
```

Let's build the Helm package: 

```bash
helm package tomcat
```

Let's now define the repo index: 

```bash
helm repo index .
```
Let's add a new repository to the Helm client, it's a lot like adding a project to a GitHub repository: 

```bash
helm init
helm repo add (img name) (repo link)
helm repo update
helm install (repo name) --name tomcat
helm status tomcat
helm delete tomcat
```
## Starting with Travis CI

Let's get a vaild `.travis.yml` going: 

```yaml
language: minimal
if: branch = master

before_install:
  - curl -L https://git.io/get_helm.sh | bash
  - helm init --client-only

script:
  - mkdir files-to-gh-pages
  - echo $(pwd)
  - helm package charts/tomcat-prod -d files-to-gh-pages
  - helm package charts/tomcat -d files-to-gh-pages
  - cp README.md files-to-gh-pages
  - cd files-to-gh-pages
  - helm repo index .
  - ls -ltr 
  
deploy:
  provider: pages  
  github_token: $GITHUB_TOKEN
  local_dir: files-to-gh-pages
  target_branch: gh-pages
  verbose: true
  skip_cleanup: true
  keep_history: true
  on:
    branch: master
 ```
 
 As you can see we are going to push this to a `gh-pages`, via the hook `provider: pages`. Now let's make a folder in our project entitled `charts` then inside of `charts` let's make one called `tomcat`. I made a `.helmignore` file, and I'll share it below:
 
 ```bash
 # Negation (prefixed with !). Only one pattern per line.
.DS_Store
.git/
.gitignore
.bzr/
.bzrignore
.hg/
.hgignore
.svn/
*.swp
*.bak
*.tmp
*~
.project
.idea/
*.tmproj
.vscode/
```
In your `tomcat` directory let's make a file called `Chart.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
appVersion: "9.0.26"
description: A Helm chart for Tomcat 9 (with Oracle openjdk13)
name: tomcat
version: 0.1.2
```

Now we need to make another `yaml` file, as I said in. the beginning - Helm's method of action is getting configuration settings from `yaml` files. Let's call this file `values.yaml`: 

```yaml
replicaCount: 3

image:
  repository: tomcat
  tag: 9.0.26-jdk13-openjdk-oracle
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

imagePullSecrets: []
nameOverride: ""
fullnameOverride: ""

service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 8080
  targetPort: 8080

ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "tomcat"
    # kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
  hosts:
    - host: (your host)
      paths: []

  tls: []

resources: {}

nodeSelector: {}

tolerations: []

affinity: {}
```
